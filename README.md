# Machine-Learning-from-Data
### This repository contains the assignments from the "Machine Learning from Data" course (3141) in the computer science faculty at IDC.
The course presented the main principles of data-driven learning algorithms. Providing the theoretical basis for learning algorithms and learn about the pros and cons of different approaches, from a mathematical point of view. 
Students will implement and use algorithms and will practice their
application in real-life data contexts.
