# hw3 - Bayesian Learning
Implement a few variants of MAP (Maximum a posteriori estimation) classifiers.

## In this exercise you will perform the following:
* Implement a Naive Bayes Classifier based on Multi-Normal distribution.
* Implement a Full Bayes Classifier based on Multi-Normal distribution.
* Implement a Discrete Naive Bayes Classifier.
* Compare all the different models.
