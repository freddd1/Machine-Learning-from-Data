# hw2 - Decision Trees
Implemented a Decision Tree model using mainly `NumPy`. 
* Construct a decision tree algorithm.
* Implement two impurity measures: Gini and Entropy.
* Prune the tree in diffrent methods to achieve better results. The methods are post-pruning, Chi-Square pre-pruning.
* Visualize your results.
